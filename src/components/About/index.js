I went to KU coding bootcamp and learned alot during my time there. I spend my days with my hands in many different parts of web development from back-end programming (Java, javaScript, mySQL and OOP) to front-end (HTML, CSS and jQuery). Im also familiar with graphQL. I enjoy spending my free-time with my husband and son, camping, watching sports(football) and playing video games.
